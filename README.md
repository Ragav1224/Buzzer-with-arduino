This code was created for Q-Fiesta quiz competition for school students organized by Helping hands, Faculty of Engineering, University ofJaffna on 2019.

Its Arduino code for buzzer. Push buttons, buzzer and LEDs used here for this project. 
When pressing a buzzer, all other buzzers will disable for 3 seconds and after 3 seconds it will reset. 
So we can easily find the participant who pressed first.

3 codes have created here.
1. Named as Quatter_final.
	Here 7 teams on same stage.
2. Named as Semi_final
3. Named as Semi_final_v2.0
	These both are similary same. Two teams are on same stage and each team has five participants.
